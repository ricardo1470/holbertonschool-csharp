| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Universal health](./0-universal_health/) | public class called `Player` |
| [1. Damage delegation](./1-damage_delegation/) | Based on `0-universal_health`, create a delegate `CalculateHealth` that takes a float amount |
| [2. Validation](./2-validation/) | Based on `1-damage_delegation`, inside the `TakeDamage()` and `HealDamage()` methods, calculate the new value of the Playerâ€™s `hp` but do not set the value of `hp` |
| [3. Modified behavior](./3-modified_behavior/) | Based on `2-validation`, outside of the `Player` class, create an enum `Modifier` with the values `Weak`, `Base`, `Strong`. Outside of the `Player` class, create a delegate `CalculateModifier` |
| [4. Check yourself](./4-check_yourself/) | Based on `3-modified_behavior`, outside of the `Player` class, create a new class `CurrentHPArgs` that inherits from `EventArgs` |
| [5. Eventful](./5-eventful/) | Based on `4-check_yourself`, create a new method `HPValueWarning` inside the `Player` class |
