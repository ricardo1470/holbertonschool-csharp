| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Abstract thinking](./0-abstract_thinking/) | Create an abstract class called `Base` |
| [1. User interface](./1-user_interface/) | Based on `0-abstract_thinking`, create an interface called `IInteractive`.  |
| [2. Escape room](./2-doors/) | Based on `1-user_interface`, delete the `TestObject` class. Create a new class called `Door` that inherits from `Base` and `IInteractive`. |
| [3. Interior decorating](./3-decorations/) | Based on `2-doors`, create a new class called `Decoration` that inherits from `Base`, `IInteractive`, and `IBreakable`. |
| [4. Key collecting](./4-keys/) | Based on `3-decorations`, create a new class called `Key` that inherits from `Base` and `ICollectable`. |
| [5. Iterate and act](./5-iterate_act/) | Based on `4-keys`, create a new class called `RoomObjects` and a method called `IterateAction`. This method should take a list of all objects, iterate through it, and execute methods depending on what interface that item implements. (ex: if the item uses `IInteractive`, your `IterateAction` method should call `Interact()` on it) |
| [6. Better iterating and acting](./6-generic_iteration/) | Based on `5-iterate_act`, remove the `RoomObjects` class created in the previous task. Create a new generic class `Objs<T>` that creates a collection of type `T` objects that can be iterated through using `foreach`. |
